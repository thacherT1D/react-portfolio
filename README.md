## Portfolio Site Built with React




#### Build Notes

Started build using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and the [Gatsby Material Starter](https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-material-starter)

Run `gatsby develop` to start a hot-reloading development environment accessible at localhost:8000

(OR `npm run serve` per the gatsby-material-starter README)

Try editing the javascript pages in src/pages. Saved changes will live reload in the browser.
`gatsby build` will perform an optimized production build for your site generating static HTML and per-route JavaScript code bundles

`gatsby serve` starts a local HTML server for testing your built site
